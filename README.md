This repository contains tutorial on Image preprocessing in Python. There
are two jupyter notebooks. One notebook explores Image processing using
the Python Imaging Library (PIL) the second notebook uses TensorFlow 2.0 
for Image preprocessing. This includes resizing, cropping, rotating among
other operations.
